          Docker has revolutionized the way we develop, deploy, and run applications. If you've heard the term "containers" 
          and wondered what the fuss is about, this guide will clarify everything and show you why Docker is now essential 
          for modern development.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Docker?</h2>
        <p>
          Docker is a containerization platform that packages your application and all its dependencies (libraries, runtime, etc.) 
          into a single unit called a container. This container can run consistently on any system that has Docker installed.
        </p>

        <h2>Virtual Machines vs Containers</h2>
        <p>
          Before Docker, developers used virtual machines (VMs) to ensure consistent environments. However, VMs are heavy 
          and resource-intensive. Containers are lighter, faster, and more efficient:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>VMs:</strong> Simulate entire operating systems with massive overhead</li>
          <li><strong>Containers:</strong> Share the host OS kernel, much lighter and faster</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <p>
          A Docker image is a template or blueprint. It contains everything needed to run your application: code, libraries, 
          dependencies, and configuration. Images are read-only and serve as the foundation for containers.
        </p>

        <h3>Containers</h3>
        <p>
          A container is a running instance of a Docker image. You can think of an image as a class and a container as an object 
          in programming. Multiple containers can run from the same image.
        </p>

        <h3>Registry</h3>
        <p>
          Docker Hub is the official Docker registry where people share images. You can pull (download) images created by others 
          or push your own images to share with the community.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting Started with Docker</h2>

        <h3>Installing Docker</h3>
        <p>Download Docker Desktop from <code>docker.com</code> and follow the installation instructions for your OS.</p>

        <p>Verify installation:</p>
        <pre><code>$ docker --version
Docker version 24.0.0, build abc1234</code></pre>

        <h2>Your First Container</h2>

        <p>Running a simple container:</p>
        <pre><code>$ docker run hello-world
Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.</code></pre>

        <p>
          Congratulations! You just ran your first Docker container. The <code>docker run</code> command pulled the 
          <code>hello-world</code> image from Docker Hub and executed it.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          Docker fundamentally changed how we think about deployment. Once you grasp these basics, you're ready to containerize 
          your own applications and explore advanced topics like Docker Compose and Kubernetes orchestration.
        </p>
